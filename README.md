# Resume Template

This is a resume template written in LaTeX, based on the work of Andrew Li and xxx. 

\*Contains convenient macros to make headers among other things

To facilitate multilingual application processes, this template is heavily modified. To add a new language you need to add a new makefile goal, a resume-xx.tex file and the relevant macros in the main tex file. This way of working ensures that updates are more likely to propagate to all possible languages and save you any headaches later.

There are also a number of different header styles, as the original style was unneccessarily wasteful.
